# Investment Planning Tools

A collection of offline web tools for finances

## Rebalance Calculator
A quick prototype of an investment planning tool I originally created in Google Sheets with Google AppsScript. Provides a basic
use case for planning a portfolio's allocation, and re-balancing. Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) and Progressive Web App (PWA)
 using Vite (React/TS template), Tailwind, and Daisy UI.
