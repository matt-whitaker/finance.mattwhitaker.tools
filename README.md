# Investment Planning Tool

A quick prototype of an investment planning tool I originally created in Google Sheets with Google AppsScript. This takes the same
underlying logic I put together there into an offline PWA using Create React App, Tailwind, and Daisy UI. Doesn't allow
for much customization beyond the number of entries at each hierarchy.

It's main focus is making it easy to calculate re-balancing targets for planned portfolio.
